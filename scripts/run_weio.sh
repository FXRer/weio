# OpenWRT patch python to disable the byte compilation by default
# https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/541
# This change is annoying as WeIO is mainly composed of python code.
# This environment variable tells python to byte compile the code, which drastically
# speed up the execution time
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=0

# Launching WeIO application, if application crashes WeIO will rerun automaticaly
# On each exit from application script checks if an update is needed
# Update process once decompressed new version to RAM exits application, script will
# do the rest of moving files to good target
